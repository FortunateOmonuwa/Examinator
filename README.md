## üé® Frontend Development

The frontend is built with React and uses modern development practices:

- **Component-based architecture**
- **React Hooks** for state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Responsive design** principles

### Key Components

- `Header` - Navigation header with branding
- `Footer` - Site footer with links
- `Home` - Landing page with features showcase
- `ExaminerRegistration` - Registration form for examiners

## üîß Backend Development

The backend follows a clean architecture pattern:

- **Controllers** handle HTTP requests/responses
- **Services** contain business logic
- **Models** define data structures
- **Routes** define API endpoints
- **Utilities** provide helper functions

### Database Schema

The application uses PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM. Key entities include:

- **UserProfile** - Base user information
- **Examiner** - Examiner-specific data
- **Student** - Student-specific data
- **Exam** - Exam information
- **Question** - Exam questions
- **Option** - Question options
- **ExamAttempt** - Student exam attempts
- **Answer** - Student answers
- **AuthManager** - Authentication and authorization management
- **StudentExam** - Mapping between students and exams

## üöÄ Deployment

### Backend Deployment

1. Set up PostgreSQL database
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Deploy to your preferred platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.)

### Frontend Deployment

1. Build the frontend:

   ```bash
   cd src/frontend
   npm run build
   ```

2. Deploy the build artifacts to your hosting platform (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Examinator project! To ensure code quality and consistency, please follow these guidelines:

### Development Guidelines

1. **Follow Project Structure** - Maintain the existing project structure and organization patterns. This ensures consistency across the codebase and makes it easier for other developers to understand and maintain the code.

2. **Backend Testing Requirements** - All backend implementations **must** include comprehensive unit tests. This is mandatory for:

   - Controllers
   - Services/Business logic
   - Utility functions
   - API endpoints
   - Database operations

3. **Code Quality Standards**
   - Follow existing naming conventions
   - Use consistent code formatting (Prettier configuration provided)
   - Write clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Document complex functions and business logic

### Contribution Process

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. **Maintain project structure** - Place files in appropriate directories following existing patterns
4. **Write unit tests** for all backend functionality (see `src/backend/tests/` for examples)
5. Run tests to ensure they pass: `npm test`
6. Run linting: `npm run lint`
7. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
8. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
9. Open a Pull Request to the dev branch with:
   - Clear description of changes
   - Test coverage report
   - Screenshots for UI changes (if applicable)

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: Required for all backend services, controllers, and utilities
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage
